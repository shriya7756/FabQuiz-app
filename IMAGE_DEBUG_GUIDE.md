## üöÄ CRITICAL: Follow These Steps EXACTLY

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server ‚ö°

**Stop the server** (Ctrl+C in server window), then:

‚úÖ You should see:
```
Server running on port 3001
```

### Step 2: Restart Frontend ‚ö°

**Stop the frontend** (Ctrl+C in frontend window), then:
```bash
cd c:\Users\HP\Downloads\Fabquiz-app\FabQuiz-app-main
npm run dev
```

‚úÖ You should see:
```
VITE ready
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache üóëÔ∏è

**VERY IMPORTANT!**
- Press `F12` to open DevTools
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
- OR use Incognito/Private mode

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Test 1: Create Quiz with Image

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Login and go to Admin Dashboard
3. Create a question
4. **Upload an image** (IMPORTANT: Use a NEW image, not an old one)
5. You should see the preview immediately
6. Add the question
7. Generate quiz code

**Check Server Console:**
```
‚úÖ Image uploaded successfully: /uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg
‚úÖ File saved to: C:\Users\HP\Downloads\Fabquiz-app\FabQuiz-app-main\uploads\question-xxxxx.jpg
```

### Test 2: Join Quiz as Participant

1. Open **NEW browser tab** or **Incognito mode**
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173/join/YOURCODE`
3. Fill in details and join
4. **Press F12** to open console BEFORE starting quiz
5. Look for these logs:

**Expected Console Output:**
```
üì• Quiz data loaded: {quiz object}
üìä Total questions: 1
üñºÔ∏è Questions with images: [
  {
    text: "Your question...",
    hasImage: true,
    imageUrl: "/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg",
    fullUrl: "http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg"
  }
]
```

### Test 3: Play Quiz and Check Images

1. Start the quiz
2. Watch the console for:

**If Image Loads Successfully:**
```
üñºÔ∏è Displaying image: {
  original: "/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg",
  computed: "http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg",
  question: "Your question..."
}
getImageUrl: Constructed URL: http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg from /uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg
‚úÖ Image loaded successfully! http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg
```

**If Image Fails:**
```
‚ùå Failed to load image!
Original URL: /uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg
Attempted URL: http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg
Server should be: http://localhost:3001
üîÑ Trying fallback URL: http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg
```

## üîç Debugging Checklist

### ‚úì Server Running
- [ ] Server is running on port 3001
- [ ] Server console shows "Server running on port 3001"
- [ ] No errors in server console

### ‚úì Image Upload
- [ ] Image uploaded successfully
- [ ] Server shows: "Image uploaded successfully: /uploads/..."
- [ ] File exists in `uploads/` folder
- [ ] Image preview works in admin dashboard

### ‚úì Quiz Creation
- [ ] Server shows: "Creating questions with images: [...]"
- [ ] Image URL is present in the logged data
- [ ] No errors during quiz creation

### ‚úì Quiz Retrieval
- [ ] Server shows: "Returning quiz by code: XXXXX"
- [ ] Server shows: "Questions with images: [...]"
- [ ] Image URL is included in the response

### ‚úì Browser Console
- [ ] Shows "üì• Quiz data loaded"
- [ ] Shows "üñºÔ∏è Questions with images"
- [ ] Image URL is present in the data
- [ ] Shows "üñºÔ∏è Displaying image"
- [ ] Shows "‚úÖ Image loaded successfully!" (if working)

### ‚úì Network Tab
- [ ] Open F12 ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Filter by "Img"
- [ ] Look for request to `/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg`
- [ ] Status should be **200 OK**

---

## üÜò If Images STILL Don't Show

### 1. Check Image File Exists

**In CMD:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\HP\Downloads\Fabquiz-app\FabQuiz-app-main
dir uploads
```

You should see files like:
```
question-1234567890-123456789.jpg
```

### 2. Test Direct Image Access

1. Find the image URL from console (e.g., `/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg`)
2. Open in browser: `http://localhost:3001/uploads/question-xxxxx.jpg`
3. **You should see the image directly**
4. If not, server is not serving images correctly

### 3. Check Server Logs

Look for "Image request:" in server console when you access the image URL.

**Should see:**
```
Image request: /question-xxxxx.jpg
```

### 4. Check CORS

In browser console, look for CORS errors:
```
Access to image at 'http://localhost:3001/uploads/...' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS
```

If you see this, the server CORS is not configured correctly.

### 5. Verify MongoDB Data

The image URL should be saved in MongoDB. Check server logs when creating quiz to verify `imageUrl` field is being saved.

## üìä What Each Console Log Means

| Log | Meaning | Action if Missing |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| `üì• Quiz data loaded` | Quiz retrieved from API | Check API call |
| `üñºÔ∏è Questions with images` | Image URLs in data | Check server response |
| `getImageUrl: Constructed URL` | Helper built full URL | Check helper function |
| `üñºÔ∏è Displaying image` | Attempting to render | Check React component |
| `‚úÖ Image loaded successfully!` | Image displayed! | SUCCESS! |
| `‚ùå Failed to load image!` | Image failed to load | Check file exists |
| `üîÑ Trying fallback URL` | Auto-retry with alt URL | Wait for retry |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Incognito Mode** to avoid cache issues
2. **Keep F12 open** to see all logs
3. **Check BOTH** server console AND browser console
4. **Create NEW quiz** after restarting servers
5. **Use small image** (< 1MB) for faster testing
6. **Try different image formats** (JPG, PNG)

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Images are working when you see:

1. ‚úÖ Server: "Image uploaded successfully"
2. ‚úÖ Admin: Image preview appears
3. ‚úÖ Server: "Creating questions with images"
4. ‚úÖ Server: "Returning quiz by code"
5. ‚úÖ Browser: "üì• Quiz data loaded"
6. ‚úÖ Browser: "üñºÔ∏è Questions with images" (hasImage: true)
7. ‚úÖ Browser: "‚úÖ Image loaded successfully!"
8. ‚úÖ Visual: **Image appears on screen!**

**If all these steps pass and images still don't show, there's a deeper issue. Share the console logs with me!**
