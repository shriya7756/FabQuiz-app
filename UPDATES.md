# FabQuiz Updates

## Recent Improvements

### 1. **Optimized Quiz Creation Performance** âœ…
- **Issue**: Quiz creation showed "Creating your quiz..." for too long
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced `Promise.all` with `insertMany` for batch question creation
  - Improved loading toast management with proper dismiss handling
  - Added better error handling and validation
  - Quiz creation now completes in 1-2 seconds instead of appearing stuck

### 2. **Image Upload for Questions** ðŸ“¸
- **New Feature**: Add images to quiz questions from your local system
- **How to Use**:
  1. When creating a question, you'll see an "Question Image (Optional)" section
  2. Click "Upload Image" or select a file directly
  3. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP (Max 5MB)
  4. Preview the image before adding the question
  5. Remove images with the trash icon if needed
- **Technical Details**:
  - Images are stored in the `uploads/` directory on the server
  - Uses multer middleware for secure file handling
  - Automatic file validation and size limits
  - Images are served via `/uploads/` endpoint

### 3. **Fully Responsive Design** ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
- **QR Code & Join Link**: Optimized for all devices
  - **Mobile (< 640px)**: Smaller QR code (160x160px), stacked layout

  - **Desktop (> 768px)**: Large QR code (256x256px), full layout
- **Copy Buttons**: Added copy functionality for both code and link
- **Responsive Text**: Font sizes scale appropriately across devices
- **Touch-Friendly**: All buttons and interactive elements are properly sized for mobile

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**

- Improved error messages
- Image preview in questions during quiz participation
- Responsive image display (max-height: 384px) in quiz view

## Installation

To use the new features, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the new `multer` package required for image uploads.

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables are required. The app uses the existing configuration.
